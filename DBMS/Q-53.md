# What is the GROUP BY clause in SQL? How is it used with aggregate functions? 

- The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".

- The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.

### `Syntax`
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);
```
### `Example`
```sql
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;
```
