What is the difference between OOP and POP? 

--> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP allows the decomposition of a problem into entities called objects, which encapsulate data and functions.

----Key characteristics of OOP include:

>> Encapsulation: Data is hidden and can only be accessed through functions associated with the object.

>> Inheritance: Objects can inherit properties and behaviors from other objects.

>> Polymorphism: Functions can operate differently based on the object they are acting upon.


--> Procedural Oriented Programming (POP)

In POP, data moves freely around the system, and functions can access and modify global data.

            --Key characteristics of POP include:

>> Top-Down Approach: Programs are designed from the top level down to the smaller functions.

>> Global Data: Data is often shared globally among functions, making it vulnerable to accidental changes.

>> Function-Based: Emphasis is on the sequence of actions to be performed.


           -- Key Differences:-

Approach: OOP follows a bottom-up approach, while POP follows a top-down approach.

Division: OOP divides programs into objects, whereas POP divides programs into functions.

Data Security: OOP provides data security through encapsulation, while POP lacks data hiding mechanisms.

Inheritance: OOP supports inheritance, allowing code reuse and extension, whereas POP does not.

Access Control: OOP uses access specifiers (public, private, protected) to control access to data, while POP does not have access control.
