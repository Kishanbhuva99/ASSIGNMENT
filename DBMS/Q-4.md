# What are the key features of SQL? 

1. Data Definition Language (DDL): 
SQL provides a set of commands to define and modify the structure of a database, including creating tables, modifying table structure, and dropping tables.
2. Data Manipulation Language (DML): 
SQL provides a set of commands to manipulate data within a database, including adding, modifying, and deleting data.
3. Query Language: 
SQL provides a rich set of commands for querying a database to retrieve data, including the ability to filter, sort, group, and join data from multiple tables.
4. Transaction Control: 
SQL supports transaction processing, which allows users to group a set of database operations into a single transaction that can be rolled back in case of failure.
5. Data Integrity: 
SQL includes features to enforce data integrity, such as the ability to specify constraints on the values that can be inserted or updated in a table, and to enforce referential integrity between tables.
6. User Access Control: 
SQL provides mechanisms to control user access to a database, including the ability to grant and revoke privileges to perform certain operations on the database.
7. Portability: 
SQL is a standardized language, meaning that SQL code written for one database management system can be used on another system with minimal modification.
