#  What is the purpose of specifying data types and constraints during table creation? 

**the purpose of data type and constraints :**

- Maintaining data integrity  SQL constraints ensure that the data stored in a database is accurate and consistent by enforcing rules that prevent invalid or inconsistent data from being entered.
- Avoiding errors By preventing invalid or inconsistent data from being entered, SQL constraints help avoid errors that can arise from incorrect data.
- Improving performance  By enforcing data rules at the database level, SQL constraints can help improve the performance of database queries and reduce the risk of application crashes.
- Enforcing business rules  SQL constraints can be used to enforce business rules and ensure that data entered into a database meets the requirements of the organization, leading to more effective decision-making and data analysis.
- Enforcing restrictions on the type of data that goes into a database table to protect it from malicious attacks and ensure consistent data.
- Maintaining data accuracy and integrity by limiting the types of data that can be inserted into a table.
