|GROUP BY|	ORDER BY|
|---|---|
|Group by statement is used to group the rows that have the same value.	|Whereas Order by statement sort the result-set either in ascending or descending order.|
|It may be allowed in CREATE VIEW statement.	|While it does not use in CREATE VIEW statement.|
|In select statements, it is always used before the order by keyword.	|While in the select statement, it is always used after the group by keyword.|
|An attribute cannot be in the group by a statement under the aggregate function.	|Whereas in order by statement, the attribute can be under aggregate function.|
|In group by clause, the tuples are grouped based on the similarity between the attribute values of tuples.	|Whereas in order by clause, the result set is sorted based on ascending or descending order.|
