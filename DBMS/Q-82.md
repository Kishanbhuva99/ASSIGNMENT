# When is it useful to use savepoints in a database transaction

- Error Recovery: Roll back to a savepoint if a part of a transaction fails, while keeping successful operations intact.
- Multi-step Transactions: Manage complex transactions with multiple operations that may need selective rollback.
- Conditional Rollback: Roll back specific operations based on conditional logic.
- Optimizing Long Transactions: Prevent unnecessary rollbacks by committing or setting savepoints during lengthy transactions.
- Business Logic Handling: Ensure data integrity while managing multiple related updates or inserts in a transaction.

In short, savepoints provide flexibility in managing complex transactions 
by allowing partial rollbacks and offering finer control over the flow of operations within a transaction. 
This makes it easier to recover from errors, manage large operations, and implement complex business logic.
