# Explain the role of clauses in SQL statements. 

**There are various uses of clauses in SQL based on the type of clause. The uses of some of the clauses in SQL are mentioned below:**

- ORDER BY

To sort the database records, you can use the ORDER BY clause in SQL. This clause in SQL is used to arrange the fetched data in ascending or descending order based on the requirements.
- WHERE

The WHERE clause in SQL is used to fetch the data or certain records that match the specified condition in the SELECT statement. SQL's WHERE clause is also used with the DELETE, UPDATE, etc. statements.
- GROUP BY

Another usage of the clause in SQL is to group the rows that have the same values in the result set, and this can be achieved by using the GROUP BY clause in SQL.
- TOP

If you want to determine the total number of record rows in the result then you can use the TOP clause in SQL.
- AND

The AND clause is used with the UPDATE and DELETE statements and returns the resultant dataset only when all the conditions given with the AND clause are satisfied.
- OR

The OR clause is also used with the UPDATE and DELETE statements and returns the resultant dataset when one or more than one condition is satisfied.
- LIMIT

When the amount of data in the database is very large, the LIMIT clause is used to restrict the number of rows from the database records
