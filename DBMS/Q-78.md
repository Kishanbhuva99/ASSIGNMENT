# When would you use an explicit cursor over an implicit one

1. Use of Implicit Cursors:

- You are working with single-row queries.
- You don't need to manipulate or iterate through a result set.
- You are performing simple DML operations like SELECT INTO, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

2. Use of Explicit Cursors:

- You need to process multiple rows of data.
- You require more control over the query and how the result set is processed.
- You need to use cursor attributes to check conditions (e.g., %FOUND, NOTFOUND, etc.).
- You need to perform complex logic for each row or fetch data in a specific sequence.

**In short, implicit cursors are great for simpler operations, while explicit cursors give you more flexibility and control when working with more complex queries and result sets.**
