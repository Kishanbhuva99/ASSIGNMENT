# What is the role of NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints? 

1. NOT NULL 
If we specify a field in a table to be NOT NULL. Then the field will never accept null value. That is, you will be not allowed to insert a new row in the table without specifying any value to this field. 
For example, the below query creates a table Student with the fields ID and NAME as NOT NULL. That is, we are bound to specify values for these two fields every time we wish to insert a new row. 
 ### `Example`
 
```sql
CREATE TABLE Student
(
ID int(6) NOT NULL,
NAME varchar(10) NOT NULL,
ADDRESS varchar(20)
);
```

2. UNIQUE 
This constraint helps to uniquely identify each row in the table. i.e. for a particular column, all the rows should have unique values. We can have more than one UNIQUE columns in a table. 
For example, the below query creates a table Student where the field ID is specified as UNIQUE. i.e, no two students can have the same ID. Unique constraint in detail. 
 ### `Example`
 
```sql
CREATE TABLE Student
(
ID int(6) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
NAME varchar(10),
ADDRESS varchar(20)
);
```
