# When is it useful to use savepoints in a database transaction

**Partial rollbacks:** Rollback to a specific point in a transaction rather than rolling back the entire transaction.

**Error handling:** Handle errors selectively by rolling back only part of the transaction and leaving the rest intact.

**Nested transactions:** Manage operations within nested transactions without affecting the outer transaction.

**Complex business logic:** Test different paths or conditions within the same transaction, and undo operations selectively.

**>Transaction consistency:** Maintain consistency during long-running transactions and ensure that operations before a failure are preserved.

**Avoiding unnecessary rollbacks:** Avoid rolling back an entire transaction when only part of it needs to be undone.
