# List and explain the main advantages of OOP over POP.

<b>1. Improved software-development productivity:</b>  
        <p>Object-oriented programming is modular, as it provides separation of duties in object-based program development.
It is also extensible, as objects can be extended to include new attributes and behaviors.
Objects can also be reused within an across applications.
Because of these three factors – modularity, extensibility, and reusability – object-oriented programming provides
improved software-development productivity over traditional procedure-based programming techniques. </p>
<n></n>
<b>2. Improved software maintainability:</b>
        <p>Since the design is modular, part of the system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale changes.</p>
<n></n>
<b>3. Faster development:</b>
       <p> Reuse enables faster development.
Object-oriented programming languages come with rich libraries of objects,
and code developed during projects is also reusable in future projects. </p>
<n></n>
<b>4. Lower cost of development:</b>
      <p>  The reuse of software also lowers the cost of development.Typically, more effort is put into the object-oriented analysis and design, which lowers the overall cost of development.</p>
<n></n>
 
<b>5. Higher-quality software:</b>
        <p>Faster development of software and lower cost of development allows more time and resources to be used in the verification of the software.
Although quality is dependent upon the experience of the teams, object oriented programming tends to result in higher-quality software.</p>

What is OOP? List OOP concepts

Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming.
Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance,
hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming.

The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and 
the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

OOPs Concepts:

1. Class
2. Objects
3. Data Abstraction 
4. Encapsulation
5. Inheritance
6. Polymorphism
