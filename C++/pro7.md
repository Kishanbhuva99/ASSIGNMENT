2. Double-click the downloaded file to extract and launch the installer.

3. Review the GNU General Public License, and when you are ready to install, click Next.

7. Select a text editor you want to use with Git. Use the drop-down menu to select Notepad++ (or whichever text editor you prefer) and click Next.

If you prefer to use a CLI text editor in Git Bash, select nano or Vim from the list.

8. The next step allows you to choose a different name for your initial branch. The default is master. Unless you are working in a team that requires a different name, leave the default option and click Next.

9. The next step allows you to change the PATH environment. The PATH is the default set of directories included when you run a command from the command line. Keep the middle (recommended) selection and click Next.

10. The installer prompts you to select the SSH client for Git to use. Git already comes with its own SSH client, so if you don't need a specific one, leave the default option and click Next.

15. The next step is to choose which credential helper to use. Git uses credential helpers to fetch or save credentials. The default option is the most stable one. Select your preferred credential manager and click Next.

16. The next step lets you decide which extra options to enable. If you use symbolic links, which represent shortcuts for the command line, tick the box. Keep file system caching checked and click Next.

17. Depending on which Git version you are installing, it may offer to install experimental features.

For the most stable operation, do not install experimental features and click Install.
