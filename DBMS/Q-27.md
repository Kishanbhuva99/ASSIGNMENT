# What are the implications of dropping a table from a database? 

- Invalidation of views or stored procedures dependent on the dropped table.
- Loss of data in the table and any associated triggers.
- Inability to recover the information once the table is dropped.
- Complete elimination of the table, including all data, indexes, constraints, and permissions.
