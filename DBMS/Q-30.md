# Define the INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands in SQL.

- INSERT

The INSERT INTO statement in SQL is used to add new rows of data to a table in a database.
There are two main ways to use the INSERT INTO statement by specifying the columns and values
explicitly or by inserting values for all columns without specifying them.

### `syntax`
```SQL
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3) 
VALUES( value1, value2, value); 
```

### `Example`
```SQL
CREATE DATABASE StudentDB;

CREATE TABLE Student (
    ROLL_NO INT PRIMARY KEY,
    NAME VARCHAR(50),
    ADDRESS VARCHAR(100),
    AGE INT
);

INSERT INTO Student (ROLL_NO, NAME, ADDRESS, AGE) VALUES
(1, 'Ramraj', 'Delhi', 12),
(2, 'Ramji', 'Gurgaon', 18),
(3, 'Sumit', 'Rohtak', 20),
(4, 'karim', 'Rohtak', 28);

```

- UPDATE

The UPDATE statement in SQL is used to update the data of an existing table in the database.
We can update single columns as well as multiple columns using the UPDATE statement as per our requirement.

### `Syntax`
```SQL
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2,â€¦ 
WHERE condition;
```

### `Example`
``` SQL
UPDATE Student SET Name  = 'Nitin' WHERE Age = 28;
```

- DELETE

The SQL DELETE statement removes one or more rows from a database table based on a condition specified in the WHERE clause.

### `syntax`
```SQL
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE some_condition;
```

### `Example`
```SQL
DELETE FROM Student WHERE Name='Ramji;
```
