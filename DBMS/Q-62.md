# Explain the advantages of using views in SQL databases.

### Advantages of View:
**Complexity:** Views help to reduce the complexity. Different views can be created on the same base table for different users.

**Security:** It increases the security by excluding the sensitive information from the view.

**Query Simplicity:** It helps to simplify commands from the user. A view can draw data from several different tables and present it as a single table.

**Consistency:** A view can present a consistent, unchanged image of the structure of the database. Views can be used to rename the columns without affecting the base table.

**Data Integrity:** If data is accessed and entered through a view, the DBMS can automatically check the data to ensure that it meets the specified integrity constraints.

**Storage Capacity:** Views take very little space to store the data.

**Logical Data Independence:** View can make the application and database tables to a certain extent independent.
