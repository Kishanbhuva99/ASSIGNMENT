# Explain the use of the ORDER BY and WHERE clauses in SQL queries.

- ORDER BY: 
SQL uses the ORDER BY statement to sort records. You can sort records in ascending or descending order and order by Sorts the results set based on one or more columns.
<n></n>
Ascending order is set by default but you could also add the "ASC" keyword to your statement.
<n></n>
The DESC or DESCENDING keyword lists data in descending order.
<n>
</n>
- WHERE: 
We used the WHERE clause several times already to show you how to filter records when you use SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. You can use the WHERE clause with or without the ORDER BY statement. where clause Filters rows based on specified conditions.
