# What is a stored procedure in SQL, and how does it differ from a standard SQL query? 

###### SQL Stored Procedures :
- A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.
- Stored procedures allow for code that is used repeatedly to be saved on the database and run from there, rather than from the client. This provides a more modular approach to database design.


###### Syntax :

```sql
    CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
    AS
    sql_statement
    GO;
```
